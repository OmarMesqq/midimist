### a unified media tracking and review platform with social media-like features
This project was born during [PUC-RIO's interactive applications course - INF1039](https://www.puc-rio.br/ferramentas/ementas/ementa.aspx?cd=INF1039).
Our team made on-campus interviews and discovered a potential market demand for a unified media (books, games, TV shows, etc) platform. 

Interviewed people highlighted how they currently track 
their media consumption on paper or use multiple apps (Letterboxd, Goodreads, etc) which can be mentally exhausting. Midimist aims to address this issue.
